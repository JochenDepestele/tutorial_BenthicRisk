# We first went to the appropriate directory (cd ..) and then we imported a template using the Terminal (instead of the console) in RStudio and the following command:
  # quarto use template EmilHvitfeldt/website-template
  # The template can also be found here: https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/website-template/tree/main
# And then we modified the template to fit our purpose, and we published it through the Terminal using the commands:
  # quarto publish quarto-pub
  # published with the account jochen.depestele@ilvo.vlaanderen.be (github account allowing Quarto access)
  # and pushing 'enter' created the site (with a name automatically given to it)
# NEXT STEP is to add links to the various subpages: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k65E-8PXZmA
  # structure: by creating qmd files in the root (it can also be in subfolder where the QMD-files are sitting)
  # navigation: by adding text and a link to the file in the navbar in the _quarto.yml file

### Introduction

This tutorial falls under SEAwise’s work on modelling the impact of fisheries on benthic ecosystems under Work Package 4: Ecological effects of fisheries. 

SEAwise largely built upon the assessment methodology from the ICES Working Group on Fisheries Benthic Impact and Trade-offs ([WGFBIT Github tutorial](https://github.com/ices-eg/FBIT/tree/master/TAF%20-%20ICES%20tutorial){target="_blank"}) and applied it to several regional seas ([Van Hoey et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.24049767.v1){target="_blank"}). SEAwise also connected these benthic impact risk assessments to (1) spatial modelling approaches to evaluate spatial management scenarios (see [Van Hoey et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.28078970.v1){target="_blank"}; Bastardie et al. [2023](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.24331198.v1){target="_blank"}, [2024](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.28079429.v1){target="_blank"}, [2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2025.1629180){target="_blank"})
and to (2) mixed fisheries models to evaluate effort-related management scenarios developed in a Management Strategy Evaluation framework ([Kempf et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.25152662.v1){target="_blank"}, [2025](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.28081649.v1){target="_blank"}, [Garcia et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.29108039.v2){target="_blank"})

Three steps will showcase benthic impact risk assessments (WP4) using outputs from effort-related fisheries management scenarios of the mixed fisheries model *FLBEIA* in the North Sea.

1.  Simulating [**depletion scenarios**](1_depletion_scenarios.qmd) by matching métier resolutions of benthic impact assessments (Benthis-métiers) with fisheries métiers of mixed fisheries models (e.g. NS FBLEIA métiers).

2.  Fast [**RBS estimation**](2_RBS_estimation.qmd) for many simulated scenarios using a vectorized methodology from the [terra](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/){target="_blank"} package.

3.  [**MSFD assessment**](3_MSFD_indicators.qmd) of seafloor integrity.
