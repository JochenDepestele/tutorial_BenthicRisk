Relative Benthic State (RBS) is a quantitative risk indicator of the benthic biomass under mobile bottom-contact fishing, expressed as the fraction of biomass remaining relative to the unfished carrying capacity of the community (1 = no depletion; 0 = fully depleted) using the balance between fishing‚Äêinduced mortality and natural recovery. RBS is derived by solving a Schaefer(1954)-type of logistic population model at equilibrium, with an additional term to estimate recurring depletion induced by mobile fishing gears ([Ellis et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0426){target="_blank"}, [Pitcher et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12705){target="_blank"}, [Hiddink et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1618858114){target="_blank"}). Depletion is assumed to occur with an average intensity estimated by the Swept-Area Ratio *SAR* or the number of trawl passes per unit area per year and the depletion rate *d* or the fraction of biomass that each pass removes (see [Depletion scenarios](1_depletion_scenarios.qmd)). Let *B* be the benthic biomass, *K* the unfished carrying capacity and *r* the intrinsic recovery rate (see [Benthic sensitivity](2_1_Benthic_sensitivity.qmd)), then the equilibrium is found at:

$$
\text{RBS} = \frac{B}{K} = 1- \frac{d \cdot \text{SAR}}{r}
$$

RBS is a linear index that falls between 0 and 1 to explicitly indicate that benthic state declines with fishing frequency and intensity (*d*), and improves with faster recovery (*r*).
