    "text": "Introduction\nThis tutorial falls under SEAwise’s work on modelling the impact of fisheries on benthic ecosystems under Work Package 4: Ecological effects of fisheries.\nSEAwise largely built upon the assessment methodology from the ICES Working Group on Fisheries Benthic Impact and Trade-offs (WGFBIT Github tutorial) and applied it to several regional seas (Van Hoey et al. 2023). SEAwise also connected these benthic impact risk assessments to (1) spatial modelling approaches to evaluate spatial management scenarios (see Van Hoey et al. 2024; Bastardie et al. 2023, 2024, 2025) and to (2) mixed fisheries models to evaluate effort-related management scenarios developed in a Management Strategy Evaluation framework (Kempf et al. 2024, 2025, Garcia et al. 2025)\nThree steps will showcase benthic impact risk assessments (WP4) using outputs from effort-related fisheries management scenarios of the mixed fisheries model FLBEIA in the North Sea.\n\nSimulating depletion scenarios by matching métier resolutions of benthic impact assessments (Benthis-métiers) with fisheries métiers of mixed fisheries models (e.g. NS FBLEIA métiers).\nFast RBS estimation for many simulated scenarios using a vectorized methodology from the terra package.\nMSFD assessment of seafloor integrity.\n\n\nGet Started"

    "text": "Relative Benthic State (RBS) is a quantitative risk indicator of the benthic biomass under mobile bottom-contact fishing, expressed as the fraction of biomass remaining relative to the unfished carrying capacity of the community (1 = no depletion; 0 = fully depleted) using the balance between fishing‐induced mortality and natural recovery. RBS is derived by solving a Schaefer(1954)-type of logistic population model at equilibrium, with an additional term to estimate recurring depletion induced by mobile fishing gears (Ellis et al. 2014, Pitcher et al. 2017, Hiddink et al. 2017). Depletion is assumed to occur with an average intensity estimated by the Swept-Area Ratio SAR or the number of trawl passes per unit area per year and the depletion rate d or the fraction of biomass that each pass removes (see Depletion scenarios). Let B be the benthic biomass, K the unfished carrying capacity and r the intrinsic recovery rate (see Benthic sensitivity), then the equilibrium is found at:\n\\[\n\\text{RBS} = \\frac{B}{K} = 1- \\frac{d \\cdot \\text{SAR}}{r}\n\\]\nRBS is a linear index that falls between 0 and 1 to explicitly indicate that benthic state declines with fishing frequency and intensity (d), and improves with faster recovery (r).",

Longevity was defined as the fuzzy-coded maximum lifespan of a taxa (e.g. Bolam et al. 2014) and spatially mapped by predicting the untrawled state of benthic communities in sediments with slower-growing, larger-bodied and longer-lived macrobenthic biota following the methodology of Rijnsdorp et al. 2018, which is described in detail in the ICES-WGFBIT tutorial on Github), and applied in SEAwise to several regional seas (Van Hoey et al. 2023).\n\n\n\nMedian longevity following Rijnsdorp et al. 2018.

    "text": "Depletion is estimated from the times that a location is fished (fishing frequency) and the proportion of biota that are killed by a single pass of a mobile fishing gear (depletion rate d). Fishing frequency was estimated for mobile fishing gears only as the sum of area that is annually fished (or the swept area) divided by the surface area of the studied grid cell, defined as the Swept Area Ratio (SAR). Depletion should typically be estimated at high spatial resolution (here: 0.05° resolution), because mobile fisheries are spatially clustered (Hiddink et al. 2017, Amoroso et al. 2018). Depletion is estimated at métier level.\nBenthic impact risk assessments have categorized fishing métiers to discriminate for the width and penetration depth of the gears, such as the Benthis-métiers (Eigaard et al. 2016, Rijnsdorp et al. 2020). Mixed fisheries models typically categorize fisheries using fleet and métiers, whereby fleets are based on country, broad gear groups and vessel length while mixed fisheries métiers are defined within fleets in terms of catchability of a commercial fish stock (Garcia et al. 2017, Kühn et al. 2023).\nData on Benthis métiers typically involves fishing frequencies at higher spatial resolution (0.05° by 0.05°) than mixed fisheries métiers, while mixed fisheries métiers comprise data on catch composition of commercial fish stocks at higher and more appropriate resolution of the fishing métiers. To estimate depletion of mixed fisheries scenarios, we first estimate the depletion of Benthis métiers, and then aggregated those Benthis métiers to match the mixed fisheries métiers and enable assessment of their benthic impact risk. Matching Benthis métiers to mixed fisheries métiers allows the estimation of benthic impact risk for a range of mixed fisheries scenarios. Matching datasets of Benthis-métiers with mixed fisheries métiers requires downscaling the analysis to the lowest common denominator, implying a lower resolution categorization of fishing métiers for benthic impact assessment.",

Recovery rates of short-lived taxa are higher (e.g. r = 5.31/1 for taxa with a life span of one year) than that of long-lived ones (e.g. r = 5.31/3 for a three year life span).

    "text": "Seafloor integrity is one of the 11 Descriptors in European environmental legislation to protect the marine ecosystem and biodiversity, i.e. Descriptor 6 in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD 2008/56/EC). This tutorial follows the rationale of the MSFD implementation for setting thresholds, which is defined under the fifth criterion stipulating adverse effects on habitats (D6C5). Two thresholds determine Good Environmental Status: one for habitat extent and one habitat quality.\n\nThe maximum proportion of a benthic broad habitat type in an assessment area that can be adversely affected is 25 % of its natural (habitat) extent (≤ 25 %) (see the Commission Notice on the threshold values C/2024/2078). Broad habitat types (BHT) were defined by the EUSeaMap 2023 (Vasquez et al. 2023), while the areal proportions were estimated using grid cell resolution of 0.05 degrees. The proportion of its natural extent are shown for the Greater North Sea as a whole, but can also be estimated by jurisdiction, e.g. UK, EU and Norwegian waters or by national waters defined by the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ).\nThe threshold for the habitat extent was agreed upon, but the D6 implementation has to this date (August 2025) not decided which thresholds and benthic indicators will be used for assessment of habitat quality, i.e. what constitutes an adverse habitat impact. RBS classifies as one of the candidate indicators for its responsiveness to bottom trawling, but might have to be complemented with benthic (diversity) indicators to provide a more comprehensive understanding of seabed impacts (Van Denderen et al. 2024). This tutorial is focused on RBS implementation and arbitrarily selected three threshold values (RBS = 0.75, 0.8 and 0.9) to assess which habitat types achieve this target. The 0.8 threshold was also used as cutoff in the ICES workshop WKBENTH2 and Pitcher et al. 2022. All values are at the upper boundary of the ranges discussed in Hiddink et al. 2023.\n\nThe code and figure below illustrate which BHT achieved the 75% habitat extent threshold at the scale of the Greater North Sea using three habitat quality thresholds (RBS=0.75, 0.8 or 0.9).\n\n\nCode\n# LOAD DATA ####\nNSmask &lt;- terra::vect(\"./input/NSmask.shp\")\nshelfslope_r &lt;- terra::rast(\"./input/shelfslope_r.tif\")\ndeplscen_r &lt;- terra::rast(\"C:/Users/jdepestele/OneDrive -
